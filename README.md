# Battleship

[Online preview](https://lenikota.github.io/Battleship/)


- check how site looks on mobile (change the way the setup window is being displayed, it doesn't work properly)<br>
- add ability to move ships when they already placed on the setup board<br>
- Change the logic: Check the wiki and other people's projects. If you hit a ship, you can continue to hit without taking a turn against your opponent until you miss.<br>
- may be revert colors, primary black and others more light (color palette site), i thing it will fix the isuee, try right away chaning in the broswer pane those varables<br><br>

- Todo: Optimize using ChatGPT randomAttackOpponent (there's a branch for that, use the method the getTilesAroundShip function uses to check tile validity).<br>
- ask CHATGPT can i improve something or write in a more clear way, add and commit as an optimization<br>
- add to the readme.md the gameboard, player and ship classes description<br>
- todo When everything complete test the game (all functionality (if saves are added, quitting in the middle of the game, closing the tab) winning, losing many times then (again quitting, saving)); if there will be time check how others achieve the result
